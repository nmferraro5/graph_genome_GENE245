# graph_genome_GENE245
Code for term project in GENE 245
Represent differences in allele frequencies between populations as a reference graph

Quantify a new sequence's alignment to the graph via the most likely path

v
Reference + Variants_for_Individuals (VCF files from 1000 genomes project) -> Allele frequencies in populations -> Graph representation
|
v
Allele frequency model + graphical Representation
|
v
To represent population variation and enable individual assignment to populations

Challenges:
- Visual
- Stats
- New seq -> most likely path
- Cluster seqs based on variants
- How transition matrix varies â€“> summary metric
