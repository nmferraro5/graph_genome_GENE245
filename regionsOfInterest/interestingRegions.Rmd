### Genomic regions with expected high inter-population variation

Classic sweep examples: accepted examples of classic sweeps (that is, DARC, HERC2, MCM6, SLC24A5, SLC45A2

#### rs2789823 in VAV2 has 185 haplotypes in AFR population alone
#### SLC24A5 
- Involved in skin color, pigmentation 
- 15:48426484
- High DDAF 

#### DARC (Colonna et al 2014, Fig 1)
- DDAF = .943 for AFR-EUR
- 1:159174683

rs6014096 in DOCK5 (AFR-ASN) 
rs1596930 in EXOC6B (AFR-ASN)
rs12903208 in PRTG (AFR-ASN)

#### GSTCD
- DAF 0.85 in ASN 0.03 in AFR and 0.58 in EUR

#### ABCA12 
- ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A member 12
- Suspected to be important in skin pigmentation adaptation in out-of-Africa expansion
- SNP: rs10180970 - DAF of 0.96 in Asia and 0.91 in Europe, compared with 0.13 in Africa

#### ZNF804A - SNPs + indels
- Regulation of TX factor related to schizophrenia
- intronic polymorphism (rs1344706) 
- rs4667001 in the fourth exon changes mRNA levels
- Exomic INDEL, a novel variant; chromosome 2, position 185802211
  - post-TL modifications
  - present at high frequency in the ASN population 
  - DAF=0.83 versus 0.58 and 0.07 in EUR and AFR, respectively
- Phosphorylation of other proteins (for example, the deubiquitinating enzyme OTUB1) has been demonstrated to regulate susceptibility to pathogens of the Yersinia family [48], of which some members probably evolved in China [49], and thus we speculate that the insertion may have been selected in relation to pathogen resistance.



### Notes
Mapping to the standard reference (the PGF MHC haplotype) results in large fluctuations in coverage and many poorly mapped reads (Fig. 1a). However, when the reference is augmented with an additional haplotype, identified by comparing the classical HLA genotypes of the sample with those of the eight reference haplotypes and noting that one of the eight haplotypes is a close match, read coverage and alignment are greatly improved (Fig. 1b,c).

1. Variance-aware reference structure: Pop VCF 1000 genomes. 
2. Algorithms to match HTS seq data to (1) + Detect novel variation (new path?)
3. Project variation-aware ref onto primary sequence
4. Benchmarks

No genomic region/SNP/variant with high DDAF appears more than once in Colonna et al 2014 supplementary table 2.
